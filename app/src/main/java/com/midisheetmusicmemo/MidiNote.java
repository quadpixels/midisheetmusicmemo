 * A MidiNote contains

 * starttime - The time (measured in pulses) when the note is pressed.
 * channel   - The channel the note is from.  This is used when matching
 *             NoteOff events with the corresponding NoteOn event.
 *             The channels for the NoteOn and NoteOff events must be
 *             the same.
 * notenumber - The note number, from 0 to 127.  Middle C is 60.
 * duration  - The time duration (measured in pulses) after which the 
 *             note is released.
 *
 * A MidiNote is created when we encounter a NoteOff event.  The duration
 * is initially unknown (set to 0).  When the corresponding NoteOff event
 * is found, the duration is set by the method NoteOff().
