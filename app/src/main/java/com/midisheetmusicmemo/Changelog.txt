- Added tutorial videos to the website.


MidiSheetMusic 2.1 (Feb 6, 2011)

- Ported MidiSheetMusic to Ubuntu Linux, using C#/Mono.
  It uses Timidity for playing the MIDI sound.

- Changed how we choose black notes.  Before, we would use either all
  sharps or all flats, depending on the key signature.  If the key
  was F major (1 flat), then we only use flats (e.g. we use G-flat
  instead of F-sharp).  Now, we use the following method:

  * Use F# and C# instead of G-flat and D-flat
  * Use B-flat instead of A#
  * For all other black keys, use the same accidental (sharp/flat)
    that the key signature uses. For C major, use sharps.

  This required modifications to the KeySignature methods
  GetWhiteNote and GetAccidental.

- Changed MidiFile.ReadTrack so that if it encounters a truncated
  Midi file, it returns what it has parsed so far, instead of 
  throwing an exception.

- Improved the accuracy and speed of the MidiFile.SplitTrack() method.

- Previously, the Volume slider only worked on Windows XP.
  Fixed it to work on Windows Vista and Windows 7.

- When printing, include the MIDI filename at the top of the first page.

- Fixed errors in the MusicSymbolDiagram at the bottom of README.html.

- Display the message "Use the menu File:Open to select a MIDI file" on
  startup.
