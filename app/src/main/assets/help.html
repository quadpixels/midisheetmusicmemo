  A picture of the main playback screen is shown below:
  <p>
  <img src="playback_screen.png" />
  <p>
  The playback controls are at the top, with the piano and
  sheet music underneath.  The playback controls, from left
  to right, are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Rewind</b> Rewind the music by one measure
    <li><b>Stop</b> Stop the music, and return to the start of the song.
    <li><b>Play</b> Start playing the music.
    <li><b>Fast Forward</b> Fast forward the music by one measure. 
    <li><b>Speed Bar</b> Change the speed of the music playback, from
        1 to 100% of the original speed.
  </ul>
  <p>
  When the play button is pressed, and the music starts playing,
  the playback controls are temporarily hidden, to give more
  screen space to the piano and sheet music.
  <p>
  To pause the playback, simply tap anywhere on the screen.
  <p>
  The Android menu button has four options:
  <ul>
    <li>Choose Song: Choose another song
    <li>Settings: Adjust the sheet music settings
    <li>Save As Images: Save the sheet music as PNG images (one per page). 
        The images are saved to the album Pictures/MidiSheetMusic.
    <li>Help: Show this help screen
  </ul>
  <p>

  <h2>Sheet Music Settings </h2>
  You can adjust the following Sheet Music Settings:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Select Tracks To Display</b> <br/>
      MIDI files are divided into tracks, where each track generally
      represents a separate musical instrument (piano, violin, etc).
      The piano songs that come with MidiSheetMusic use two tracks:
      one for the left hand and one for the right hand.  For example,
      if you enable only the right-hand track, then only the right-hand
      notes are displayed and played.
    <li><b>Select Tracks To Mute</b> <br/>
      You can mute individual tracks during playback. The tracks are still displayed.
    <li><b>Select Instruments For Each Track</b> <br/>
      For each track, you can choose what instrument to use during playback.
    <li><b>Scroll Vertically</b> <br />
      Scroll the sheet music either vertically or horizontally during playback.
    <li><b>Show the Piano</b> <br />
      When checked, the piano notes will be highlighted during playback.
      You can hide the piano to give more screen space to the sheet music.
    <li><b>Show Lyrics</b> <br />
      If the MIDI file contains lyrics, display them.
    <li><b>Show Note Letters</b> <br />
      When checked, display the note letters next to each note.
      You can display either English letters (C, C#), Do-Re-Mi, or Numbers.
      With Fixed Do-Re-Mi and Numbers, Do (number 1) is always the letter C.
      With Movable Do-Re-Mi and numbers, Do (number 1) is the first letter of the key signature.
    <li><b>Transpose Notes</b> <br />
      Transpose the notes up or down. This changes both the sheet music
      and the pitch of the notes during playback.
    <li><b>Key Signature</b> <br />
      MIDI files often do not include the key signature of the music.
      In those cases, MidiSheetMusic must guess the key signature.
      You can override the key signature used in the sheet music by
      changing this option. This option does not affect the pitch of
      the notes during playback.
    <li><b>Time Signature</b> <br />
      MIDI files often do not include a time signature.  In those cases,
      MidiSheetMusic will default to 4/4 time.  You can override the
      default time signature using this option.
    <li><b>Combine Interval</b> <br />
      MidiSheetMusic must determine whether a group of notes belong to
      the same chord.  Notes that are played at the exact same time
      definitely belong to the same chord.  However, notes that are
      played just a couple milliseconds apart will sound as if they
      are played at the same time.  These notes should also be part
      of the same chord.  This option determines the interval (in
      milliseconds) that notes will be considered part of the same
      chord.
    <li><b>Right Hand Color</b> <br />
      Select the color used for highlighting the right hand notes.
    <li><b>Left Hand Color</b> <br />
      Select the color used for highlighting the left hand notes.
    <li><b>Show Measure Numbers</b> <br />
      Display the measure numbers in each staff.
    <li><b>Play Measures in a Loop</b> <br />
      Play a subset of measures continuously in a loop. This it useful for
      learning small parts of a song at a time.
    <li><b>Start/End Measure</b> <br />
      Select the measure range to play in a loop.
  </ul>

  <h2>What is a MIDI file?</h2>
  <p>
  A MIDI file is a type of music file. It is a standard format for
  recording music from electronic instruments, such as electronic
  keyboards/pianos.  
  <p>
  MidiSheetMusic comes with over 50 sample classical piano songs.
  You can also download additional MIDI files from the Internet,
  and open them with MidiSheetMusic. When choosing a song, you
  browse the filesystem for MIDI files.
